********# Multithreaded Linux Application Using POSIX Threads and Mutexes********

## Project Overview

This project is a **Multithreaded Linux Application** developed using the C programming language and POSIX Threads.

The application follows a **Producer-Consumer model**, where the main thread reads tasks from an input file and adds them to a shared task queue. Three worker threads retrieve and process the tasks concurrently.

The project demonstrates important Operating Systems concepts including **process/thread creation, thread synchronization, mutexes, condition variables, shared resources, signal handling, and graceful thread termination**.

## Problem Statement

In a multithreaded application, multiple worker threads may need to access the same shared data simultaneously. Without proper synchronization, this can lead to race conditions and inconsistent results.

This project implements a thread-safe task processing system where:

* The main thread produces tasks.
* Multiple worker threads consume tasks.
* A shared circular queue stores pending tasks.
* Mutexes protect shared resources.
* A condition variable coordinates worker threads.
* SIGINT handling provides graceful shutdown.
* Processed results are stored in an output file.

## Objectives

* Implement multithreading using POSIX Threads.
* Create and manage multiple worker threads.
* Implement a shared circular task queue.
* Synchronize access to shared resources using mutexes.
* Use condition variables for thread coordination.
* Process multiple tasks concurrently.
* Store processing results in a file.
* Implement graceful s
